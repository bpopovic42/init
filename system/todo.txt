Make a script to install vagrant.

Needs to be called from zshrc and included in my .cfg.

It needs to check wether I'm at school or not before attempting installation.

It should check if the box (debian/stretch64) is available in the sgoinfre
download it there if it doesn't and install from it afterwise in order to speed up
the process

Then allow user to setup a new machine with a given name of choice,
it would set everything up in the goinfre with machine specs, name, and synced folder.
