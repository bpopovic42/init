Make a script to install vagrant.

Needs to be called from zshrc and included in my .cfg.

It needs to check wether I'm at school or not before attempting installation.

It should check if the box (debian/stretch64) is available in the sgoinfre
download it there if it doesn't and install from it afterwise in order to speed up
the process

Then allow user to setup a new machine with a given name of choice,
it would set everything up in the goinfre with machine specs, name, and synced folder.

Check if domain == 42
	Create folders (~/goinfre/vagrant, ~/goinfre/vagrant/setup, ~/sgoinfre/vagrant)
	Export paths
	If vagrant user aliases don't exist
		Create aliases

Aliases :

vagrant_42 new_project [PROJECT-NAME] :
	Create new project of name PROJECT_NAME
	If PROJECT_NAME folder (case insensitive) exist in .cfg
		Export corresponding Vagrantfile
		Run installation commands
	Else if PROJECT_NAME doesn's exists in .cfg
		Ask user if he wants to import his own Vagrantfile for the project
			case y : take file path
			case n : skip
		Ask user if he wants to create an empty project
			case y : Tell user to add machine with 'vagrant_42 add_machine',
				Create project folder and basic 'empty' vagrantfile
			case n : exit

vagrant_42 add_machine [PROJECT_NAME] [MACHINE_NAME]
	If PROJECT_NAME exists in $VAGRANT_DIR
		Ask for machine type (ex : debian/stretch64)
			If machine type setup exits in .cfg
				Import corresponding setup into project's Vagrantfile
			Else tell user default machine will be installed and that he can modify it later on and :
				config.vm.box = "debian/stretch64"
				vagrant init type
	Else
		'Invalid project name use vagrant_42 new_project [PROJECT_NAME] to create a new one'

TODO :
Put project script in its own ~/.vagrant_42 folder and its own repo for modularity and deployment purpose
Find how to configure installation to deploy custom packages and config files (hostname, bashrc...)
Find a way to backup vm config between sessions if desired (different goinfre)
