From 'man ssh' :

~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	Lists the public keys (DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA) that can be used for logging in as this user.  The format of this file is
	described in the sshd(8) manual page.  This file is not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for
	the user, and not accessible by others.

~/.ssh/authorized_keys
