IPV6 details
============

## Address deconstruction

As in IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses are splitted into two components: a network component and a node component.

This was done initially using Address Classes and later using Subnet Masking.

The IPv6 address is split into two 64 bits segments, the top 64 bits is the network part and the lower 64 bits the node part
